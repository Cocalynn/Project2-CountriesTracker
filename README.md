## Description

Welcome to Countries Tracker, the perfect platform for recording all of your travels and planned trips! 

With Countries Tracker, you can create an account, add the countries you've visited, and mark the ones you want to visit in the future. Our platform allows you to view your travel history and make changes as needed, so you can easily keep track of your adventures.

In addition to personal tracking, Countries Tracker also provides an admin dashboard where you can view statistics for all users. As an admin, you can see which countries are the most popular, which users have visited the most countries, and other interesting data. This information can help you gain insights into global travel trends and plan future updates to the platform.
